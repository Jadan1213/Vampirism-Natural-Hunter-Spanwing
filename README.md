# Vampirism-Natural-Hunter-Spanwing

## # **What is this?**
I made a small datapack to enable Hunters and Advanced Hunters spawn naturaly in the overworld.

This is useful if you wish to disable Hunter tent spawning in the Vampirism config.

Since it contains tags for the werewolf heaven biome, Werewolves may be required as well or it could crash. I have not tested this, but have listed both as required dependencies.

Feel free to use this in your modpack!

## # **Version**
This was created for the Forge 1.20.1 version of the game. I have not tested this on other versions.

## # **Datapack loading**
For easy loading of datapacks and resource packs, I recommend using **[Paxi](https://modrinth.com/mod/paxi)** by Yung! 

## # **Issues**
If you run into issues using this, or need help, Feel free to @ me on the Vampirism discord!

## # **Special Thanks**
**Special thanks to the creators of **[Vampirism](https://modrinth.com/mod/vampirism)** and **[Werewolves](https://modrinth.com/mod/werewolves)** Cheaterpaul and Maxanier for such amazing mods!**
